# Best of R

<div align="justify">

A repository of all resources and packages about R that I find interesting.

## Text mining

**[Text mining with R.](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)** Book. A great GitHub resource with code for cutting-edge text mining with R.

## Data manipulation

**[zeallot.](https://github.com/r-lib/zeallot#zeallot)** Package. A clever way to unpack data from objects such as data frames or lists into newly defined vectors using a new operator: %<-%.

**[dlstats.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlstats/vignettes/dlstats.html)** Package. It reports monthly downloads of any package on CRAN or Bioconductor across time.
