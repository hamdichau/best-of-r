# Best of R

<div align="justify">

A repository of all resources and packages about R that I find interesting.


## To learn R

**[DataCamp.](https://swirlstats.com/)** Tutorial. A fantastic collection of tutorials on R, including introduction to the basics as well as more advanced topics.

**[Quick-R.](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)** Tutorial. A fantastic website with anything one would need to start analyzing data using R.

**[Swirl.](https://swirlstats.com/)** Tutorial. An R package that teaches you how to use R within R.

## Syntax

**[Pipes.](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial)** Tutorial. A fantastic and comprehensive tutorial on how to use pipes in R - these are now becoming standard in R syntax.

**[magrittr.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)** Package. Tutorial. The standard package for the commonest pipes used in R - very useful to go through as it introduces many super-useful operators. I especially like "%<>%", which uses and updates an object at the same time.

**[Hadley Wickham's Style Guide.](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)** Tutorial. Guidelines. This in combination with the style guide by Google (referenced in the website) are the most standard coding styles in R.



## Text mining

**[Text mining with R.](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)** Book. A great GitHub resource with code for cutting-edge text mining with R.



## Data manipulation

**[dplyr.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)** Package. Tutorial. By far the most popular package for data manipulation in R. Part of the tidyverse.

**[data.table.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)** Package. Tutorial. Probably the second most popular package for data manipulation in R. This package is much faster than dplyr and thus preferred when using large datasets. It uses a somewhat unique syntax.

**[zeallot.](https://github.com/r-lib/zeallot#zeallot)** Package. A clever way to unpack data from objects such as data frames or lists into newly defined vectors using a new operator: %<-%.



## Data summarization

**[broom.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)** Package. Tutorial. A great package to summarize models fit into meaningful data frames.

**[stargazer.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf)** Package. Tutorial. A great package to automatically produce summary tables in HTML or LaTeX ready for publication.

**[skimr.](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr)** Package. Tutorial. Produce pretty summary tables where the last column represents a histogram of the data. It can output directly into R and as an HTML table.

**[summarytools.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/Introduction.html)** Package. Tutorial. Produce pretty summary tables and contingency tables.



## Data visualization

**[ggplot2.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)** Package. Tutorial. By far the most popular package for data visualization in R. Look for visualization packages starting with "gg" - these contain custom functions to produce plots using ggplot2.

**[corrplot.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html)** Package. Tutorial. A package to easily produce beautiful and intuitive correlation plots.

**[viridis.](https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/amp/)** Package. Tutorial. An introduction to using viridis as a package or within ggplot2 to create plots with beautifully matching colors.

**[ggeffects.](https://www.r-bloggers.com/marginal-effects-for-regression-models-in-r-rstats-dataviz/amp/)** Package. Tutorial. A package to easily produce pretty ggplots of predicted value distributions across model specifications.

**[dotwhisker.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dotwhisker/vignettes/dotwhisker-vignette.html)** Package. Tutorial. A fantastic package to easily produce ggplots of coefficients from models fit and compare.



## Data analysis

**[H2O.](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/glm/glm.md)** Package. Tutorial. A fantastic package for speeding up the process of fitting machine learning models. This is a tutorial illustrating how to use the H2O package.



## Open Science

**[dlstats.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlstats/vignettes/dlstats.html)** Package. It reports monthly downloads of any package on CRAN or Bioconductor across time.



## Cloud computing

**[googleCloudStorageR.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleCloudStorageR/vignettes/googleCloudStorageR.html)** Package. Tutorial. A report on how to interact with the Google Storage API of the Google Cloud Platform through R.
