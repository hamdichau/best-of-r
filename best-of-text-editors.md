# Text editors

<div align="justify">

New text editors appear all the time. This is a list of text editors I find particularly good. If you happen to read this, please contribute any text editors you do not see here, but which you like! I hope you find this resource useful.

## Markdown

* **[stackedit.](https://stackedit.io/app#)** Free. Open Source. Neat editor with good features, including sharing, working on a document concurrently, maintaining a version history and commenting. I would have liked to be able to easily export to Word (and vice versa) and to be able to align justify.

* **[Stencila.](https://stenci.la/)** Free. This appears super cool, even though I have not used it yet. It looks great for authoring Markdown documents in conjunction with underlying data science code and your data in order to produce live documents; almost like a better-looking version of R-Markdown.

## LaTeX

* **[Overleaf/ShareLaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/)**
