* **[What-If Tool](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/the-what-if-tool-code-free-probing-of.html?m=1)** This looks like a must-use tool when using TensorFlow to build a new model. As per the blog post "Building effective machine learning (ML) systems means asking a lot of questions. It's not enough to train a model and walk away. Instead, good practitioners act as detectives, probing to understand their model better: How would changes to a datapoint affect my model’s prediction? Does it perform differently for various groups–for example, historically marginalized people? How diverse is the dataset I am testing my model on?"
