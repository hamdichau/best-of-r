## Bayesian statistics

**[Multi-Armed Bandits, Conjugate Models and Bayesian Reinforcement Learning.](https://eigenfoo.xyz/bayesian-bandits/)** Tutorial. Examples. A fantastic website on applying Bayesian methods and Bandits. The website belongsn to George Ho, who also provides great Python code to implement theory.

**[Introduction to Bayesian Networks.](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-networks-81031eeed94e)** Tutorial. A great brief article introduction to Bayesian Networks on Medium - it has received 2.7K claps.

## Statistical practice

**[“We continuously increased the number of animals until statistical significance was reached to support our conclusions” . . . I think this is not so bad, actually.](https://andrewgelman.com/2018/09/04/continuously-increased-number-animals-statistical-significance-reached-support-conclusions-think-not-bad-actually-2/)** A very interesting thread on whether sequential data collection for as long as it takes for the data to look good is permissible. Andrew Gelman argues that it is, only if the analysis takes this sequential nature into account - if it does not, then the approach is pretty much guaranteed to yield a desirable result.
